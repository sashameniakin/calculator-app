# Calculator App

I have built the site for a calculator app. The website is responsive, you can use it on your phone, or normal desktop in 3 styles.

## TechStack

- React
- Redux
- TailwindCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS custom properties

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the app
- Make calculations
